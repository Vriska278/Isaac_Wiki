                Devil rooms typically only have one percent chance to spawn on a
                floor. There are a few ways to increase these odds. One of those
                ways it to take no red heart damage on the current floor. This
                will make the percent chance go up to 100 percent. Another
                option is taking no red heart damage during a boss fight, this
                increases the chance to get a devil deal by 35 percent. Having
                certain items also increase the percentage chance of a devil
                deal appearing. These items include the pentagram, Book of
                revelations, goat head, the book of belilal, black candle,
                satanic bible wisps. Soul hearts
